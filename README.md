# ZOMBI Decompilation
A decompilation of ZOMBI (2012/2015)
This does not come with any of the actual game assets. You need a legal copy of the game from Steam or Ubisoft Connect in order to use this
This project is slow-going, don't expect it to be perfect, or for it to be completed in a short amount of time

I'd like to focus more on getting the game compilable and fully working before focusing on accuracy (which im pretty sure is literally what every decompilation does lol)
