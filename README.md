# ZombiPort
A port of ZOMBI (2015) to MacOS. Although this can be compiled cross platform
This does not come with any of the actual game assets. You need a legal copy of the game from Steam or Ubisoft Connect in order to use this
This project is slow-going, don't expect it to be perfect, or for it to be completed in a short amount of time

# Why?
I really enjoy the game, however I don't have a WiiU / I recently switched to MacOS, which means I can't play the game
Crossover has not matured enough for 32-bit support, and trying to play the game fails. I've also tried emulating it (CEMU works but again I need some form of a gamepad, ShadPS4 does mostly work but my GPU shits the bed when trying to play it for more than 5 minutes)
